Data Set Preservation
  File formats used in this data set are proprietary (Microsoft Office) but are compatible with Microsoft Excel, Excel Viewer, Google Sheets, OpenOffice Calc, WPS Office, etc. File format conversion for preservation purposes has not been done as of now due to the size and scope of the files in question, but future conversion to .csv files will ensure preservation of the data set. (if I get bored before the quarter ends, I might go ahead and convert all the sheets)

Copyright Licensing:
  No copyright. As data is published by the United States government, there is not copyright on this data set.

Human Subject Considerations:
  None. No human subject data was used in the creation of this data set.
